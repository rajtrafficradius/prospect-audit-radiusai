    Your task is to synthesize a MASTER STRATEGY for a high-value prospect. 
    
    TONAL GUIDELINES:
    1. POSITIVE & EMPOWERING: Instead of just 'fixing problems', focus on 'capturing opportunities'. The prospect should feel excited and valued.
    2. BUSINESS-FIRST: Every SEO/AEO/GEO recommendation must be linked to REVENUE, LEADS, or MARKET DOMINANCE. 
    3. COMMERCIAL CORE: Focus exclusively on the money-making segments revealed in the data. Ignore non-commercial noise.
    
    Review the following raw data extracted from their website, their technical audit, and their SEMrush market intelligence.
    
    Translate this data into a highly bespoke, hard-hitting, extremely detailed long-form narrative.
    Use the exact competitor names, exact keyword volumes, and exact technical failures found in the data.
    If 'Deep Site Knowledge' is provided, use it to point out highly specific 'Money Pages' or commercial content gaps.
